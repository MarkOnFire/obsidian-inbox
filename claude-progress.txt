## 2025-12-23 - Project Setup

### What was done:
- Created new repo from deprecated obsidian-email-to-para OAuth approach
- Set up project structure with src/, templates/, knowledge/ folders
- Created initial worker.ts skeleton with manual MIME parsing (to be replaced)
- Scraped documentation for Cloudflare Email Workers, R2 API, postal-mime, turndown
- Added dependencies: postal-mime (email parsing), turndown (HTML→MD)
- Created CLAUDE.md with project context and conventions
- Set up long-running agent infrastructure (init.sh, feature_list.json, this file)

### Current state:
- Dependencies defined in package.json but not yet installed
- worker.ts has skeleton code with TODOs - needs update to use postal-mime
- 8 features defined in feature_list.json, all pending
- Ready to begin F001: Email parsing with postal-mime

### Next session should:
1. Run ./init.sh to install dependencies
2. Update src/worker.ts to use postal-mime for email parsing
3. Implement F001 and mark as complete
4. Continue with F002-F008

### Known issues:
- None yet

### Notes:
- User prefers Markdown output (HTML converted via turndown)
- Deduplication via R2 head() check before write
- Target folder is configurable via INBOX_FOLDER env var
